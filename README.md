# odin-rockpaperscissors

Rock paper scissors with Javascript.
Used Vanilla Javascript to make rock paper scissors.
The code is very messy in my opinion, but I cleaned up a lot of it, as well as the comments for myself.

Self-reflection: This was not to bad, but it was a struggle to get past the buttons and making them work.  I also was stuck thinking I needed a function or while loop to hold the click events, when I didn't.  Overall I did pretty good.  I made a nice simplistic design that works well.  Some good ideas came at the end, and I was able to implement all of them, so I am happy about that.
